what is node.js
-> Nodejs is js runtime, then what is js runtime?
-> Node.js is another version of js, with the help of node.js we can do various action 
from the outside of the browser.
-> By using the node js we can also built server.

How node js works?
-> To understand how node js works we need to know how the js works.
-> The popular browser we use for running the js is chrome and inside the chrome
browser we use a thing called v8 engine which is written in c++.
-> This v8 engine takes the js code from the browser and the converts it into the
machine code.
-> similiarly the node js is also use the v8 engine to convert the js code into 
machine code, therefore the v8 engine plays an important role in this.
-> In browser,we cannot access the file system directly due to the security purpose,
but to use the node js as a normal programming language it should use the file systems
and the network.
-> Therefore it modifies the v8 engine to add some modules which are filesystem,Os,Http etc.
-> By using these modules we can perform the various operations inside the node js.

Installing node.js:-
-> To install node.js we can use the chrome browser.
-> Go to chrome and search for the node.js and download it at node.js.org website.
-> Set up node.js is pretty simple just agree to all the things it asked and now we 
have the node js in our system.
-> To check whther it is installed successfully in our system go to cmd and type "node -v"
and we will get the current version of the node.js in our system.
-> we can directly use the node js in cmd, to do that just type "node" in the cmd and it 
will start the node js environment in cmd.
-> This can be helpful to check small things in node js but to built large scale applications
and we need to install several files and we need the workspace for that we use an code editor 
called visual studio and we write all our nodejs code in it.
