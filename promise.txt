Promise:-
-> In js, the promise is an interface, this promise are mainly useful in the api calls
-> let say we request a api call to the server and waiting for the result on that time we
can use the promise to write the asynchronous code.
-> By using the promise we can tell the differentiate the code like if we get the response
from the browser then do this or else do this, like that.
-> Example:-

let mypromise = new promise((myResolve,myReject)=>{
   myResolve();
})

mypromise.then(() =>{
 console.log("success");
}).catch(()=>{
  console.log("Failed");
})

-> In the above example we created a variable "mypromise" and assigned the promise to it.
-> Whenever using the promises we need to use the "new" keyword before using the promises.
-> After the new keyword we created the promise function and inside it we created a arrow 
function which takes 2 parameters which are myResolve and myReject.
-> Inside the arrow function we called the myResolve function() and then we write the asynchronous
code below the function in which we use the .then() and .catch().

-> The "then" function will be executed when resolve is called or else the "catch" fucntion will be
executed.
-> In the above example the output will be "success" because we called the myresolve() in the
function.
